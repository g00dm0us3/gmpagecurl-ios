# gmpagecurl-ios - Under Construction
A page curl effect for iOS using Metal. The main idea - cylinder rolls on a sheet of paper, sheet of paper covers cylinder.

## Demo application available in dev. branch.
Use pinch gesture to zoom in and out. Use "View State" button to switch between cylindrical and box views (the idea is to smooth box over the cylinder).

## TODO
- 𝛗 and displacement input.
- Light
- Textures
- Render arbitrary views into textures (switcharoo when user starts dragging).
- Package as Pod
