# gmpagecurl-ios - Under Construction
A page curl effect for iOS using Metal. The main idea - cylinder rolls on a sheet of paper, sheet of paper covers cylinder.

## Demo application available in dev. branch.
Use pinch gesture to zoom in and out. Use "View State" button to switch between cylindrical and box views (the idea is to smooth box on the cylinder inside it - place all points around axis equidistant, yielding a circular cross-section, instead of rectangular).
